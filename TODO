- Implement an in-memory RealizationSink to support realization block by block
  (e.g. during matrix multiplication). For example it will support
  multiplication of a big DelayedMatrix A with an in-memory matrix B when
  the result is a matrix C that is small enough to fit in memory too (like B).
  E.g. A is 100k x 200k, B is 200k x 5, so C is 100k x 5.

- Document global option DelayedArray.block.size

- Add man page and unit tests for statistical methods defined in
  DelayedArray-stats.R

- Make DelayedArray contain Annotated from S4Vectors.

- Fix bug in "[" method for DelayedArray objects caused by "substitute() +
  eval()" hack. See R/DelayedArray-class.R for the details.

- Add more examples to the man pages (using the toy dataset).

- Add unit tests for round() and signif() (Math2 group).

- Add vignette.

- Support more matrix- and array-like operations.

- How well supported are DelayedArray of type "character"?

- Add more unit tests.
