- Reconsider honoring 'drop' argument when subsetting a DelayedArray object.

- Use extract_array() instead of [ in show_compact_array() so it can work on
  any array-like object that supports extract_array() (e.g. HDF5ArraySeed
  objects, DelayedOp objects, and other "seed" objects).

- Add "show" methods for the DelayedOp types.

- Add unit tests for all the DelayedOp types.

- Should backend classes (e.g. HDF5Array) be defined as:
    setClass("HDF5Array",
        contains="DelayedArray",
        representation(seed="HDF5ArraySeed")
    )
  Then validity method is not needed anymore.

- Document global option DelayedArray.block.size

- Add man page and unit tests for statistical methods defined in
  DelayedArray-stats.R

- Support delayed array replication.
  See https://github.com/Bioconductor/DelayedArray/issues/8

- Make DelayedArray contain Annotated from S4Vectors?

- Add more examples to the man pages (using the toy dataset).

- Add unit tests for round() and signif() (Math2 group).

- Add vignette.

- Support subsetting an arbitrary object by a DelayedArray or
  DelayedMatrix of type logical.

- Support more matrix- and array-like operations.

- How well supported are DelayedArray of type "character"?

- Add more unit tests.
